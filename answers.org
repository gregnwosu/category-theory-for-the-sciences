*** 2.1.2.3
a) PR → RG
b) no , i think that in the brain one cell could connect to multiple cells in the codomain

*** 2.1.2.4
a) 2 ↦ 4
b) 0 ↦ 0
c) -2 ↦ 4
d) 5 ↦ 25
e)
- → denotes an arrow that describes a *function* from the domain set to the codomain set,
- ↦ denotes an mapping from one value directly to another

*** 2.1.2.6
im(f) = {y₁,y₂,y₄}

*** 2.1.2.8
what is the image set of f(A)?
well A is given as A := {-1, 0, 1, 2, 3}
which can be seen as fₐ := x ↦ x = id, so we can compose it in our comprehension
got the answer wrong initially ,
this states the set of things such that there is a function
now as i ⊆ X can be seen as a function i → x
we can treat the subset as a function and state

i(a) composed with f that equals x, where x is from ℤ
f(A) = { x ∈ ℤ | ∃a ∈ A such that f · i(a) = x}

*** 2.1.2.10
y : {:)} → Y

*** 2.1.2.12
a) 2⁵ = 32
b) 5² = 25

*** 2.1.2.13
a) ∅
b) {1}

should be

a) {x ∈ any Set}
b) ∅

to have homSet(X,A) == to 1 for all A then there only needs to be the function that maps everything to one value
it must be a function that maps everthing to one member of a set, therefore A; the codomain must be aset of one element

to have homSet(B,X) == 1 for all B , B must be the empty set since there can only be one value for the empty set

*** 2.1.2.17
a) n!
b) yes

*** 2.1.2.19

a) no

*** 2.1.2.20
a) because the function id can be seen as x ⊆ X then , we can say the single element set , is the same as asserting membership of X
, because is function in i → i points to one element, then it is an isomorphism

*** 2.1.2.22
a) c
b) i:= {1,4,9,16,25,36,49}

*** 2.1.2.24
a) 3
b) not a set
c) infinite
d) 6
